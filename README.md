### people keep asking me: why did i repeal net neutrality? was it money? or maybe fame? or was it just pure unjustified evil? when in reality. it was none of the above. there is one reason, and one reason only as to why i did what i had done. and his name is xxxbootysupremegod. he hacked my roblox account. he griefed my private minecraft server. he left spam in my youtube tutorial account. no longer. while you were busy griefing, i was busy building a career for myself. i found you. but i wasn't going tokill you. no. you wouldn't suffer enough. first thing i did is i stole all your robux. or took back the robux you stole from other people. then with that money i got donald trump elected into office. then he put me at chairman after only 3 years of working at fcc (you thoungh it was a coincidence?). now after ten years of pure horror. i will get to look at the horror in your face. i'm already looking through your webcam as you're reading this. and it will be the last post you read. xxbootyeatersupreme i deleted the internet. now you will need to have a life. now you will learn whati'ts like to suffer my nigga
